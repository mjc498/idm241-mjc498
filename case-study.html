    <h3>Context and Challenge</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>
                    My final project for IDM241 focuses on enhancing LinkedIn's "Connect" microinteraction within the 
                    Grow Tab under the "Suggested people for you based on your recent activity" section. Conducted as a 
                    solo effort, the project was part of a Microinteractions class taught by Professor Jervis Thompson. 
                    Over the course of 10 weeks, six assignments culminated in the production of the final project: 
                    Alpha - Description, Alpha - Build, Beta - Description, Beta - Build, Final - Description, 
                    Final - Build, and this case study. The project operated on a zero-cost budget, aligning with its goal 
                    of providing students hands-on experience with modern design theories and front-end scripting languages. 
                    This project also fulfilled the class's learning objectives by focusing on the development of 
                    meaningful and effective micro-interactions.
                </p>
        
            <h4>The Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    Modern professional networking tools rely heavily on seamless and intuitive user experiences. 
                    Although functional, LinkedIn’s “Connect” feature within the Grow Tab presented opportunities 
                    for a more accessible and engaging design. This project aimed to enhance the user experience 
                    by making navigation more intuitive and refining the interaction to better align with user 
                    needs and expectations. I focused primarily on the "Connect" button, as the original design 
                    featured dull visuals and uninspiring interactions across the webpage. I recognized significant 
                    potential for improvement in the design concepts within the LinkedIn interface.
                </p>
            
            <h4>Goals & Objectives</h5>
                <p>
                    By evaluating the triggers, rules, feedback, and loops and modes, these new 
                    designs could heavily influence future user experiences. The goal of this project
                    was to create a microinteraction that users would find engaging and satisfying, 
                    encouraging them to continue using this LinkedIn feature. Success was defined by 
                    designing a smooth and intuitive interaction that felt both practical and enjoyable to use. 
                    Accessibility-friendly features and non-abrupt changes were carefully considered throughout 
                    the entire process.

<!-- SOLUTION -->
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <h4><a href="https://idm241-mjc498.netlify.app/final-build" target="_blank">Link to Final Build</a></h4>
            <h4>Container Design</h4>
                <p>
                    The container serves as the structural backbone of the microinteraction. Its clean, minimalistic design 
                    ensures that users can focus on the interactive elements without distraction. The layout is deliberately simple, 
                    with adequate spacing around each element to maintain clarity and prevent clutter. The container is fully responsive, 
                    adapting to various screen sizes while maintaining the alignment and functionality of its components. 
                    The design prioritizes accessibility, ensuring all users can interact with the container effortlessly, 
                    whether they are on a desktop or a mobile device.
                </p>
            <h4>Connect - Default Design</h4>
                <p>
                    The "Connect" button in its active state is a central feature of the interaction. The button is visually prominent, 
                    with a dark blue background and light blue text that provides excellent contrast, ensuring readability and visibility. 
                    The active state conveys a sense of readiness, inviting users to take action. Its design strikes a balance between 
                    aesthetic appeal and functionality, making it immediately clear that it is an actionable element. The button's size and
                    padding are optimized for both desktop and mobile usage, ensuring it is touch-friendly on smaller devices.
                </p>
            <h4>Connect - Active Design</h4>
                <p>
                    When the "Connect" button transitions to the pending state, it visually reflects a change in status. The color scheme 
                    remains consistent with the active state (light blue text on a dark blue background), but the text shifts to "Pending," 
                    providing immediate feedback to the user. This state effectively communicates that the action has been completed and is 
                    awaiting further processing, eliminating confusion. The subtlety of the design ensures that the button remains visually 
                    cohesive with the rest of the interface while providing necessary status updates.
                </p>
            <h4>"X" Design</h4>
                <p>
                    The "X" button serves as a secondary action for users who wish to dismiss or cancel a connection. Its design is intentionally 
                    subtle yet intuitive, with a minimal icon that does not compete for attention with the primary "Connect" button. The button is 
                    positioned strategically within the container, ensuring it is easily accessible without disrupting the visual flow. 
                    The size and color contrast make it easily identifiable while maintaining a cohesive design language with the rest of the interface.
                </p>
            <h4>View Profile Design</h4>
                <p>
                    The "View Profile" element is designed to enhance user navigation and provide additional functionality. Upon hover, the text 
                    "View Profile" appears along the top curvature of the profile picture in white, creating a dynamic and visually appealing interaction. 
                    This design choice not only reinforces the functionality of the profile image but also adds a layer of depth and sophistication to the 
                    interaction. The placement ensures that it does not interfere with other elements, while the hover state provides a clear indication of 
                    interactivity.
