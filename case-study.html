        <h3>The Overview</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    This case study focuses on the redesign of a section on the LinkedIn website -- a feature where users can 
                    "Connect" with each other on the platform. Once a user sends a connection request, they must wait for the 
                    other party to "Accept," resulting in the "Pending..." state of the icon. The original interface lacked brand 
                    uniqueness and engaging interactions. By incorporating more memorable and interactive features, users may be 
                    encouraged to increase their engagement with the platform. With my redesign, users will experience fun animations 
                    and dynamic hover states that enhance functionality and provide easy navigation. The key results demonstrate that 
                    these simple yet engaging features can significantly impact how a user perceives and interacts with an application.

        <h3>Context and Challenge</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <h4>Background</h4>
                <p>
                    My final project for IDM241 focuses on enhancing LinkedIn's "Connect" microinteraction within the 
                    Grow Tab under the "My Network" page. Conducted as a solo effort, the project was part of a Microinteractions 
                    class taught by Professor Jervis Thompson. Over the course of 10 weeks, six assignments helped in the production 
                    of my final project:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Alpha - Description</li>
                        <li>Alpha - Build</li>
                        <li>Beta - Description</li>
                        <li>Beta - Build</li>
                        <li>Final - Description</li>
                        <li>Final - Build</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    The project operated on a zero-cost budget, aligning with its goal to provide students hands-on experience with 
                    modern design theories and front-end scripting languages. This project also fulfilled the class's learning objectives 
                    by focusing on the development of meaningful and effective micro-interactions.
                </p>
        
            <h4>The Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    Professional networking tools heavily rely on seamless and intuitive user experiences. Although functional, LinkedIn’s 
                    “Connect” feature on the "My Network" page presented opportunities for a more accessible and engaging design. This 
                    project aimed to enhance user experiences by making navigation more intuitive and refining the interaction to better align 
                    with user needs and expectations. I focused primarily on the "Connect" button since the original design featured dull 
                    visuals and uninspiring interactions.
                </p>
            
            <h4>Goals & Objectives</h5>
                <p>
                    By evaluating the triggers, rules, feedback, and loops and modes, these new designs could significantly influence future 
                    user experiences. The goal of this project was to create a microinteraction that users would find engaging and satisfying, 
                    encouraging them to continue using this feature. Success was defined by designing a smooth and intuitive interaction that 
                    felt both practical and enjoyable to use. Accessibility-friendly features and non-abrupt changes were carefully considered 
                    throughout the entire process.

<!-- SOLUTION -->
    <section>
        <h3>The Solution</h3>
        <div class="text-container">
            <h4><a href="https://idm241-mjc498.netlify.app/final-build" target="_blank">Link to Final Build</a></h4>
            <h4>Container Design</h4>
                <p>
                    The container serves as the structural backbone of the microinteraction. Its clean, minimalistic design 
                    ensures that users can focus on the interactive elements without any distractions. The layout is deliberately simple
                    with adequate spacing around each element to avoid clutter. The layout is fully responsive to various screen sizes while 
                    keeping the alignment and functionality intact. The design features a hover-on state with a drop shadow, as well as a 
                    hover-off state. The cursor purposefully remains the same because this is not a button -- it is a space meant to hold the 
                    actual buttons.
                </p>
                <div class="final-gif"><img src="graphics/container.gif" alt="gif 1 of redesigned LinkedIn container"></div>
            
            <h4>Connect (Default) Design + Connect (Active) Design</h4>
                <p>
                    The "Connect" button in its default state is a key element of the interaction. It is designed to be large enough to grab 
                    the user’s attention. The classic LinkedIn blue text and outline create strong contrast against the white container, 
                    ensuring readability. The button size and padding are optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile screens which makes it 
                    touch-friendly on smaller devices. When the cursor changes to a pointer, a light blue animation slides to the right of the 
                    button container on hover and slides back out to the left when the hover ends. Additional changes occur on mouse down when 
                    the entire button fills with a light blue color to indicate it is being pressed. Finally, the text transitions from "Connect +" 
                    to "Pending..." on mouse up.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The "Connect" button becomes active when "Pending..." is displayed, indicating a change in status. The color scheme remains 
                    consistent with the default state -- blue text and outline on a white background. The same slide-in and slide-out animations 
                    are applied to the hover states, just as with the default "Connect" button design. This state signals that the action has been 
                    completed and is awaiting further processing. The button interactions remain consistent with the rest of the interface while 
                    providing necessary status updates.
                </p>
                <div class="final-gif"><img src="graphics/connect.gif" alt="gif 2 of redesigned LinkedIn connect button"></div>

            <h4>"X" Design</h4>
                <p>
                    The "X" button serves as a secondary action for users who wish to dismiss a potential connection. Its design features a minimal 
                    icon positioned strategically within the container, ensuring easy access without disrupting the visual flow. The size and color 
                    contrast make it easily identifiable while maintaining a cohesive design with the rest of the interface. Since "X" buttons are 
                    commonly associated with deletion, placing it in a less prominent area prevents accidental clicks. On hover, the "X" icon rotates 
                    180 degrees forward and rotates back when the cursor leaves. It also darkens in opacity when pressed down, causing the container 
                    to fade out as a new profile simultaneously slides in. This signals that the user has removed a potential connection and prefers 
                    to view a different profile.

                <div class="final-gif"><img src="graphics/x.gif" alt="gif 3 of redesigned LinkedIn close button"></div>
            
            <h4>View Profile Design</h4>
                <p>
                    The "View Profile" element is designed to enhance user navigation and provide additional functionality in a separate tab. Upon hover, 
                    the text "View Profile" appears along the top curvature of the profile picture in white, creating a dynamic and visually appealing 
                    interaction paired with a drop shadow. This design choice highlights the functionality of the profile image and hints at further 
                    interactions during hover on, hover off, mouse down, and mouse up.

            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, this 10-week project was a success. I met the necessary requirements to achieve my Final Build. I redesigned and 
                    developed five micro-interactions that make up LinkedIn's "Connect" container within the Grow Tab under the "My Network" page. 
                    Each feature includes its corresponding triggers, rules, feedback, and loops and modes. Presenting various phases of the project 
                    to my professor and classmates in the IDM241 course was invaluable for gathering constructive feedback and critiques.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through this project, I developed better time management skills and understood the significance of deadlines on a professional level. 
                    Academically, I am grateful for the opportunity to have a platform of my choosing, design my own interactions, and exercise creative 
                    freedom in redesigning this project. All of my design decisions were made with careful consideration of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
                    (WCAG). For example, I ensured that "View Profile" was accompanied by a shadowed background color to enhance readability for all users.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reflecting on this 10-week process, I realize it could have been more efficient if I had consistently documented and tracked the feedback I received. 
                    This would have allowed me to better evaluate my progress from the beginning of the project to its completion. Adopting a structured cycle of research, 
                    testing, designing, and development would have provided more user perspectives through surveys and other research methods, further enhancing the final
                    outcome.
